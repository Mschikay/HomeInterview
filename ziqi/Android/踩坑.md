#### override
Indicates that a method declaration is intended to override a method declaration in a supertype. If a method is annotated with this annotation type compilers are required to generate an error message unless at least one of the following conditions hold:

1. The method does override or implement a method declared in a supertype.

2. The method has a signature that is override-equivalent to that of any public method declared in Object.

    signature: It's the combination of the method name and the parameter list.
    
The signature of a method m1 is a subsignature of the signature of a method m2 if
either:

1. m2 has the same signature as m1, or
2. the signature of m1 is the same as the erasure (07003) of the signature of m2.

Two method signatures m1 and m2 are override-equivalent iff either m1 is a
subsignature of m2 or m2 is a subsignature of m1.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_stub

A stub is a routine that doesn't actually do anything other than declaring itself and the parameters it accepts and returning something that is usually the values expected in one of the "happy scenarios" for the caller. Stubs are used commonly as placeholders for implementation of a known interface, where the interface is finalized/known but the implementation is not yet known/finalized. 
##### The stub contains just enough code to allow it to be compiled and linked with the rest of the program.
