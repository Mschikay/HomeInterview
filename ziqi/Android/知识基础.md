## 4 types of components
#### Activities
An activity is the entry point for interacting with the user. 
#### Services
A service is a general-purpose entry point for keeping an app running in the background for all kinds of reasons.
#### Broadcast receivers
A broadcast receiver is a component that enables the system to deliver events to the app outside of a regular user flow, allowing the app to respond to system-wide broadcast announcements. 
#### Content providers
A content provider manages a shared set of app data that you can store in the file system, in a SQLite database, on the web, or on any other persistent storage location that your app can access.
